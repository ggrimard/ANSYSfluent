## This project aims to make it easy to read in ANSYS fluent case files (in H5 format) to Python

Hopefully this will make post processing and displaying meshes easier and more efficient then the solutions people use today.

currently only works for 3D cases with 1 zone, in other words there is still a lot to do.
